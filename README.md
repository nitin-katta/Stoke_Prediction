# Stroke Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a stroke occurrence in individuals based on various health and demographic features. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can assist in early detection and prevention strategies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze a dataset containing health-related features to identify patterns associated with stroke occurrences.  
- Preprocess and clean the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.  
- Train multiple classification models to predict stroke risk.  
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.  
- Interpret model results to derive actionable health insights.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The dataset (`dataset.csv`) includes the following features:

- **Age**: Age of the individual.  
- **Hypertension**: Whether the individual has hypertension (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  
- **Heart Disease**: Whether the individual has heart disease (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  
- **Ever Married**: Marital status (Yes/No).  
- **Work Type**: Type of employment (e.g., Private, Self-employed, etc.).  
- **Residence Type**: Urban or Rural.  
- **Avg Glucose Level**: Average glucose level in the blood.  
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: Body Mass Index.  
- **Smoking Status**: Whether the individual smokes (formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes).  
- **Stroke**: Target variable indicating whether the individual has had a stroke (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

## ðŸ”„ Data Preprocessing

The following steps were performed to prepare the data for modeling:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputed or removed missing data as appropriate.  
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features like 'Work Type', 'Residence Type', and 'Smoking Status'.  
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features such as 'Age', 'Avg Glucose Level', and 'BMI' to ensure uniformity in model training.  
- **Feature Selection**: Identified and retained relevant features based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge.

## ðŸ¤– Model Building & Evaluation

Multiple classification models were trained and evaluated:

- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  

Model performance was assessed using:

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.  
- **Precision**: Proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct.  
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.  
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.  
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
